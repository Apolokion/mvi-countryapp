# MVI-CountryApp

MVI-CountryApp is a simple Android application developed for educational purposes. It demonstrates the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern by fetching and displaying data about countries and their details from a public API.

## Features

- **Country List**: Displays a list of countries with basic information.
- **Country Details**: Provides detailed information about a selected country.

## Architecture

This application follows the MVI architecture pattern, which helps in managing the state of the application effectively and makes the codebase more maintainable. The unidirectional data flow ensures a clear separation of concerns among different components.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for Android development.
- **XML Layouts**: Used to build the user interface.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to fetch country data.
- **Room**: For local database caching.
- **Coroutines**: For handling asynchronous operations.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection.
